# Vue2.0 eleme-app-study （[点我查看中文文档](README.ZH.md)）

> A Vue.js project

Here is the project to learn while learning the Vue video of Mutu. Because of the version change, the expression here will be different from the video.

The project uses Vue2.x + pug + less + es6 + webpack, some of which will behave differently depending on your understanding during the learning process.



Project demonstration：[demo](https://womkim.github.io/vue2-eleme-demo-study/)

demoDescription：The demo viewed is deployed on github, so the Vue-source method is removed and the json method is used instead. Since github uses HTTPS, and eleme images are obtained using http, there will be warnings in the browser.: vendor.559010f….js:6 Mixed Content: The page at '...' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure image '...'. This content should also be served over HTTPS.

Regarding this study, I did some [learning records] (./record.md) related to the new version changes and the use of pug and less.
